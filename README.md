Starter code for Smart Cart Billing System

🔍 Problem Title: Smart Cart Billing System
📘 Scenario:
A supermarket has introduced a Smart Cart System that automatically reads the number of items placed in the cart using sensors. To optimize billing queues, the cart classifies customers based on the number of items:

If the number of items is even, the cart sends the customer to Counter A.

If the number of items is odd, the cart sends the customer to Counter B.

Your task is to write a program that takes the number of items in the cart as input and determines whether it should go to Counter A or Counter B.

✅ Input:
An integer n representing the number of items in the cart.

🎯 Output:
Print "Counter A" if the number is even.
Print "Counter B" if the number is odd.
